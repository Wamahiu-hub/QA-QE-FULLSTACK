//lets create a function that calculates total and average.

function average(marksArray) {
//based on the marksarray that i will pass later
//I will need to manipulate to calculate average

//get total
let total = 0
for (const mark of marksArray) {
    total = total + mark
}
//return total
}
console.log(average([123,45,678,789]))
//Adding a return type to arrow function
//Arrow functions sometimes returnimmediately and dont need a return key word
